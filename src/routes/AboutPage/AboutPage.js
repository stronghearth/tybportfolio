                <p className="myDescription">I am a burgeoning full-stack web developer based in Raleigh, NC. One of my professional writing courses in college introduced me to basic HTML and CSS which I really enjoyed. I have since tried other potential career paths, but I rediscovered coding, and I decided to give it a real shot.</p>
                <p className="myDescription">What sold me on coding is that you get a tangible result from your work and that you get to work through problems with a team around you. I love having creative outlets, including many forms of storytelling and art, but I also thrive from working with technology.</p>
                <p className="myDescription">When I am not coding, I am either hanging out with my husband and playing with my little fluff pup, or I am creatively solving fantasy world challenges with my friends playing Dungeons and Dragons. As you can see, Iâ€™m an all-around nerd!</p>
